        <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 1</h5> <!--Element #19-->
          <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Farenheit. Be sure to have the rack in the middle of the oven to evenly distribute heat to the cookies once inside.</p> <!--Element #20-->
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 2</h5>
          <p>Cook the 3/4 cup of unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat, frequently stir until browning occurs (typically 5-8 minutes). Pour into large bowl and let sit until it's harden.</p>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 3</h5>
          <p>Sift 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 tsp of baking soda, and 1/2 tsp of salt into a medium bowl and combine with a whisk.</p>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 4</h5>
          <p>Add 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 granulated sugar to the cooled browned butter. Whisk until combined. Add two large eggs, room temperature, and 2 tsps of vanilla extract. The mixture should start to lighten and thicken.</p>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 5</h5>
          <p>Add the dry ingredients and whisk. Once the dry mixture is incorporated with the wet mixture, add your chocolate chip cookies and mix with a spatula.</p>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 6</h5>
          <p>Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Recommended to use an icecream scoop to keep a consistent cookie size so that they all cook the same. Sprinkle with salt (optional).</p>
        <h5 style= "color: #5C4033">Step 7</h5>
          <p>Bake cookies for 9-11 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to serving plate. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.</p>

            When I first made these cookies with my brother, they were an instant hit. I was so happy to have finally found a recipe that satisfied my wants in a cookie. However, I recently made the cookies last year, and they were not as enjoyable as I remember, which is why my rating for consistency is so low. When I had made the cookies, it just seemed <em>incredibly buttery</em> and would <em>not</em> harden. Recently, I have made changes to the recipe to cut down on the amount of butter from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. Additionally, for the actual process of making them, I have decided to let my brown butter completely harden in the fridge instead of doing Bon Appetit's suggestion of just leaving them out til cooled. I think this helps with the consistency a lot more. I opted out of the toffee bits because I never had any laying around, plus I saw reviews saying that they were to hard to bite into. Overall, this recipe is still pretty good, just needed some fine-tuning to <em>my</em> taste! <!--Element #30-->
